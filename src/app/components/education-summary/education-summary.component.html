              My MIS program at Ohio State combined technical proficiency with business acumen through coursework in database systems, software development, and business analytics. I mastered SQL, data structures, and object-oriented programming while gaining expertise in requirements gathering, systems analysis, and business process optimization. Key technical courses included Database Systems, Data Structures in Java, and Business Application Development, complemented by business courses in Strategic Management and Financial Analysis. I balanced academics with active participation in club soccer and intramural basketball, developing teamwork and leadership skills while maintaining Dean's List standing. This comprehensive education prepared me to bridge technical implementation with business needs, making me well-equipped for roles requiring both coding expertise and business process understanding.
